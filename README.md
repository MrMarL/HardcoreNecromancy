# HardcoreNecromancy

For a hardcore server. 

If a player holding a totem in both hands writes the command /necro [nickname of the dead player], then both totems are used, after which the dead player is resurrected right in front of the resurrector, totem effects are applied to both players, and hunger for 5 minutes, nausea for 10 seconds, weakness and fatigue for 30 seconds are also imposed on the resurrected one. 

After using the command, both players (both the resurrector and the resurrected) permanently lose 3 health hearts, the team cannot be used with 4 health hearts, while in observer mode, and on live players.
